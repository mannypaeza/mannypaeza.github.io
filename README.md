## About
------
I am a final year Mathematics and Computer Science B.A student at Columbia University. I am a current research intern in the [Neural Circuits and Algorithms Group (NCA)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/neural-circuits-and-algorithms/) at the Center for Computational Neuroscience at the Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute. My research aims are in functional analysis, number theory, combinatorics, probability, and theoretical computer science.
In general, I am interested in the application of discrete and pure mathematics to algorithms research and to solving computer science problems. Previously, I did work in quantum algorithms and computational neuroscience. I am one of the co-founders and coheads of Columbia University's [Quantum Computing Club](https://cuquantumcomputingclub.github.io/).

## Personal
------

My hobbies includes playing logic games and puzzles (such as the problems in MIT Mystery Hunt), chess, reading literature, engaging with the Arts (Art Galleries, Operas, Philharmonics, etc.), traveling, and watching Bayern Munich. I am also a Mocha Coffee Enthusiast and a enthusaist for the neo-futurist and minimalist aesthetic. I also speak English, Deutsch, Français, Español, and 한국어.
