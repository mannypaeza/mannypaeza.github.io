About
------

I am Manuel Paez, a fourth-year Computer Science B.A. student at Columbia University. I am currently a Research Assistant under Szabolcs Márka in Columbia's Department of Physics and a Research Intern in the Chklovskii Group for Neural Circuits and Algorithms at Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute. I previously worked under Kiyohito Iigaya in Columbia's Department of Psychiatry. I am also the cofounder (with Akshat Yarpala) of Columbia University's [Quantum Computing Club](https://cuquantumcomputingclub.github.io/), an undergraduate group that discusses quantum information science. I speak English, Deutsch, Français, Español, and 한국어. 

Research Interests
------
 
My research aims are centered around constructing a rigorous foundation for the algorithmic theories and cryptographic tools necessary for a quantum-supremacy world. As quantum machines present endless computational possibilities compared to classical machines, particularly in algorithms, cryptography, and cryptanalysis, I want to design novel algorithms and cryptographic protocols necessary for securing our future. I desire to explore these five main questions from Quantum Algorithms, Complexity, and Cryptography:

1. What computational problems can a quantum machine solve that a classical machine with comparable resources cannot (such as NP-search problems)?

2. Related to question 1, what are the quantum algorithms that solve problems faster compared to a classical machine with comparable resources (particularly for search and graph problems)?

3. What cryptography protocols can be constructed such that it is hard for a quantum machine to solve, even if implemented on a classical machine?

4. How can we better develop a secure Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (pure-quantum) cryptographic protocol against quantum machine attacks?

5. How can quantum machines and their complexity classes help us solve complexity class problems, such as the unsolved question if P = NP?
 
I hope to explore these questions and similar questions alike while pursuing a Ph.D. candidacy. My previous research pursuits aimed at neuro-inspired AI and neuromorphic computing. My research pursuits, both past, present, and future, are centered around pursuing my ultimate dream: to create neuromorphic quantum machines and to create a quantum machine that is encoded with a sentience and consciousness comparable to a human mind. 

Aside from research, my hobbies includes solving logic games and puzzles (such as the problems in MIT Mystery Hunt), reading literature, engaging with the Arts (Art Galleries, Operas, Philharmonics, etc.), traveling, and watching Bayern Munich. I am also a Mocha Coffee Enthusiast and a huge fan of Ghost in the Shell. My aesthetic is described as a mix of minimalism and neo-futurism.
