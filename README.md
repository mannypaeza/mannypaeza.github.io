## About
------
Hello! I am a senior at Columbia University majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, advised by Alexandr Andoni. I am currently applying for summer internships and for the winter 2023/2024 job market. Some of my research interests include high-dimensional computational geometry, approximation algorithms, sublinear algorithms, and computational neuroscience. Currently, I am a guest researcher in the [Neural Circuits and Algorithms Group (NCA)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/neural-circuits-and-algorithms/) at the Center for Computational Neuroscience at the Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute, advised by Mitya Chklovskii and Jingpeng Wu. I am also a researcher in Professor Szabolc Marka's research group. Previously, I did work for Professor Kiyohito Iigaya's research group. I am one of the co-founders and I was the former cohead from 2023-2024 of Columbia University's [Quantum Computing Club](https://cuquantumcomputingclub.github.io/).

## Personal
------
In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, solving logic puzzles, reading novels, engaging with the Arts (Art Galleries, Operas, Philharmonics, etc.), and watching Bayern Munich. I also study at various cafes in New York City. I also speak English, Deutsch, Français, Español, and 한국어.
