## About
------
I am a fourth-year Computer Science B.A student at Columbia University. I am a current research intern in the [Neural Circuits and Algorithms Group (NCA)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/neural-circuits-and-algorithms/) at the Center for Computational Neuroscience at the Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute and a current researcher under Professor [Szabolcs Márka](https://www.physics.columbia.edu/content/szabolcs-marka) in Columbia's Department of Physics. My research aims are primarily in quantum algorithms, quantum games, graph algorithms, and sub-linear algorithms, but extends to the broad area of the intersection of mathematics and computer science. I am also the cofounder and cohead of Columbia University's [Quantum Computing Club](https://cuquantumcomputingclub.github.io/).

## Personal
------

My hobbies includes playing logic games and puzzles (such as the problems in MIT Mystery Hunt), chess, reading literature, engaging with the Arts (Art Galleries, Operas, Philharmonics, etc.), traveling, and watching Bayern Munich. I am also a Mocha Coffee Enthusiast and enjoy a neo-futurist and minimalist aesthetic. I also speak English, Deutsch, Français, Español, and 한국어.
