## About
------
Hello! I am a senior at Columbia University majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am currently applying for summer internships and for the winter 2023/2024 job market. Some of my research interests include high-dimensional computational geometry, approximation algorithms, sublinear algorithms, and computational neuroscience. Currently, I am a guest researcher in the [Neural Circuits and Algorithms Group (NCA)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/neural-circuits-and-algorithms/) at the Center for Computational Neuroscience at the Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute, advised by Mitya Chklovskii and Jingpeng Wu. I am also a researcher in Professor Szabolc Marka's research group. Previously, I did work for Professor Kiyohito Iigaya's research group. I am one of the co-founders and I was the former cohead from 2023-2024 of Columbia University's [Quantum Computing Club](https://cuquantumcomputingclub.github.io/).

## Personal
------

My hobbies includes playing logic games and puzzles (such as the problems in MIT Mystery Hunt), chess, reading literature, engaging with the Arts (Art Galleries, Operas, Philharmonics, etc.), traveling, and watching Bayern Munich. I am also a Mocha Coffee Enthusiast and a enthusaist for the neo-futurist and minimalist aesthetic. I also speak English, Deutsch, Français, Español, and 한국어.
